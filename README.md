# Oh, hi there!

### Welcome to this lovely repository. We've been waiting for you!

#### We're only a caterpillar and are currently in our cocoon, but we hope to soon emerge as a beautiful butterfly!

#### Oh, who are _we_?

##### _(Forgive us for neglecting to introduce ourselves! Where are our manners?!)_

#### We are Misha's 2 remaining brain cells that are currently active. She's using the other 1 to explore the Majestic world of JavaScript and the oh, so many libraries it has! How delightful! We hope she succeeds and can show you what she's learned soon!

### Bye for now!
